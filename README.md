## "Reactive Programming"
Learn more about reactivity (e.g. reactive.calc, reactive.value, reactive.event) in PyShiny.  Our goal is to write a reactive function to filter our DataFrame based on user inputs and have it immediately update in al our charts. 
Specifically, the user will have a check box group, one per species, to decide what data to show.
